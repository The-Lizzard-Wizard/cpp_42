In the dawn, an angel was dancing
Surrounded by an aura of light
But in the shadows, something was watching
And with patience awaiting the night
"Mournful night, attractive night
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbour dark beauty obsesses me."
An angel bewitched by the shadows
Seduced by the whispering lies

A spell was cast and the sky turned red
The angel's heart froze to ice
The blackness that falls is coming to stay
Under the snow lies angels so cold

Dusk has passed and a cold morning breeze
Is sweeping all over the plain
On the ground lies an angel with skin so pale
On her face an image of pain
Snow is now falling to the frozen ground
The angel is covered by white
Frost is spreading across the plain
To welcome the eternal night
